Questions：
小圆柱正确中心坐标的确定(棋盘格上哪个点：第一个输出）？以及坐标往哪里为正
图片的意思
四小圆柱误差分析

需不需要标定部分？为什么标定出来的数据不可以
4格_亚克力板_新.xlsx能不能cover所有图片？

结果
1.How to determine the correct center coordinates of the small cylinders (which point on the chessboard: the first output)? And in which direction are the coordinates considered positive?
2.Is camera calibration necessary? Why can't the calibrated data be used?
3.Does "4格_亚克力板_新.xlsx" cover all the images?
4.（qs：是否大圆（5，3），小圆（5，1））

Results:
Small cylinder center coordinates:
a. Calculated results
b. Reference results (5,1) (chessboard position)
c. Calculation of the error compared to the reference results (in millimeters)

Large circle center coordinates:
a. Calculated results
b. Reference results
c. Error between the two (in millimeters)
